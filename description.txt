Part 1

In this project, you will build the first part of a website called "Ravenous", a Yelp-like web application that you will complete over the next two and a half weeks.

Today, you will use your knowledge of JavaScript and React components to create a static of version of Ravenous. You will complete this project on your computer. Open your terminal and text editor to get started.

Good luck!

RAVENOUS PROJECT
Create Project & Components
Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you'll build a website called "Ravenous", a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

Creating Static Components
Passing Information to Components
Setting the State of Ravenous Components
Interacting with the Yelp API
Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here's a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.

Finally, a few notes before getting started:

In each project, you'll be presented with the intended, final outcome (of that project) in the Codecademy browser component.
You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It's the base of the entire app, and it will likely take a few days to complete this project. It's OK if it is not all finished in one day.
If you don't understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we'll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.
You should expect to complete all four Ravenous projects on your personal computer using your preferred tools (terminal, text editors, etc.).
Let's get started!
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Create a React App
1.
Start by creating a React app using the create-react-app package in your preferred terminal. The name of your app should be ravenous.
Stuck? Get a hint
2.
In another terminal window, cd into the Ravenous directory and type the following command:

npm start
This command will start a development server and open up a preview of your app in a browser tab. As you build, the preview will automatically update when you save your work. This is a great way of seeing your progress in real-time.
3.
Replace the current favicon located at public/favicon.ico with this.

Make sure you save the new image as favicon.ico.
Add a CSS Reset
4.
By default, create-react-app will generate a sample application. We'll need to add a reset.css file to ensure our app is styled the same in every browser.

cd into the newly created Ravenous directory. Take a look at the default folder structure generated by create-react-app. Use the command line to create a new file called reset.css in the public/ directory. Copy and paste this CSS into reset.css.
5.
Link to reset.css in the index.html file that's also located in the public/ directory.

Keep index.html open.
Stuck? Get a hint
Add Google Fonts
6.
You'll also need to add a couple of Google fonts that the app will use. In index.html, add the following links to add the necessary Google fonts:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Work+Sans:300,500,600" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:600" rel="stylesheet">
Create Business.js
7.
Great, now let's move on to some actual React code! Ravenous will be composed of four different components interacting with each other:

<Business />
<BusinessList />
<SearchBar />
<App /> (created by default with create-react-app)
You'll create all four components in this project, one by one. You can expect them to be static components for now — you'll add additional functionality later.

Let's start by creating the <Business /> component. First, you'll need to structure the Ravenous directory differently.

cd into the src/ directory. Create a new folder called components. You'll store all of your components in this directory.
8.
Each component should have its own folder inside of components/. Inside of components/, create a new folder called Business. cd into the Business/ directory and create two files:

Business.js
Business.css
Create a Sample Business
9.
Great! Now you're ready to begin creating your first React component. The purpose of the <Business /> component is to represent how a business (a restaurant) in Ravenous will be formatted and styled. For now, we'll hard code a single business listing. Later, you'll update it dynamically using the Yelp API.

Open Business.js in your text editor.

Create a JavaScript object called business. Copy the following keys and values and add them to business:

  imageSrc: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/ravenous/pizza.jpg',
  name: 'MarginOtto Pizzeria',
  address: '1010 Paddington Way',
  city: 'Flavortown',
  state: 'NY',
  zipCode: '10101',
  category: 'Italian',
  rating: 4.5,
  reviewCount: 90
Import React
10.
Perfect. The information in this object will be consumed by the <Business /> component.

To build the component using React, you'll need to import the React library.

At the very top of your Business.js file (line 1), import React.
Stuck? Get a hint
Create the <Business /> Component
11.
Next, below the business object, create a React component called Business. The component should extend React.Component.
Stuck? Get a hint
12.
Add a .render() method to the Business component.
Stuck? Get a hint
13.
Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.

Follow the guidelines below when you write the HTML (linked above) as JSX:

Change all class attributes to className.
Do not change the class values, as we will use them in the next step to add style to the business component.
Replace the relevant information with references to properties in the business object (i.e. {business.thisProperty}).
Import Business.css
14.
You added a bunch of className attributes to the HTML elements in the Business component, but they won't be very useful if we don't style those elements with CSS! Create a new file called Business.css in the Business/ directory. Add this CSS to to the Business.css file.
15.
This CSS won't be very useful if your <Business /> component can't access it. At the top of Business.js (line 2), import the Business.css file. Remember that the CSS file lives in the same parent directory as Business.js.
Stuck? Get a hint
Export the <Business /> Component
16.
You just built your first React component! Congratulations! All that's left to do is to make this component available to the rest of the Ravenous app. At the bottom of the file (last line), export the Business component.
Stuck? Get a hint
Create BusinessList.js and BusinessList.css
17.
Let's move on to the next component: <BusinessList />.

In the components/ directory, create another folder called BusinessList.

Inside of BusinessList, create two files:

BusinessList.js
BusinessList.css
18.
Add the following CSS to BusinessList.css:

.BusinessList {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 4.4rem 10%;
}
Import React and BusinessList.css
19.
Great! Now you're ready to start building this component. Start by opening BusinessList.js. At the top of the file, import the following (in this order):

The React library
BusinessList.css
Import the <Business /> Component
20.
The point of the <BusinessList /> component is to simulate what a returned list of businesses would look like in Ravenous (after querying the Yelp API, for example). To help this simulation, <BusinessList /> will make use of the <Business /> component repeatedly. To use the <Business /> component, you'll have to import it. On the next line, import the <Business /> component.
Stuck? Get a hint
Create the <BusinessList /> Component
21.
Let's start building the component. Use the React library to create a component called BusinessList.
Stuck? Get a hint
22.
Inside of the component, add a render() method.
Rendering <Business />
23.
Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.

Follow the guidelines below when you write the HTML (linked above) as JSX:

Change all class attributes to className.
Do not change the class values, as we will use them in the next step to add style to the business list component.
Replace each comment with a Business component.
Stuck? Get a hint
Export the <BusinessList /> Component
24.
That's it for the BusinessList component! This list component will need to be rendered again by another component, so you'll need to export it. At the bottom of the file, export BusinessList.
Create SearchBar.js
25.
To search for businesses (restaurants) in Ravenous, you'll need a search bar. We'll implement this with a SearchBar component.

In the components/ directory, create another folder called SearchBar.

Inside of SearchBar, create two files:

SearchBar.js
SearchBar.css
26.
Add this CSS to the SearchBar.css file.

Here are the two images you'll need for the project:

Ravenous (desktop size)
Ravenous (mobile size)
The "mobile" version should be used in any media queries you write.
Import React and SearchBar.css
27.
Great! Now you're ready to start building this component. Start by opening SearchBar.js. At the top of the file, import the following (in this order):

The React library
SearchBar.css
Create an Options Object
28.
The search bar will communicate with the Yelp API, but you'll build the functionality to communicate with the API in a later project. Today, you'll build part of the structure that's needed to communicate with the Yelp API. Specifically, requests to the Yelp API must follow formatting and naming conventions set by the API. For example, the search bar should allow users to search businesses by:

Best Match
Highest Rated
Most Reviewed
To achieve this, you'll create an object with keys and values that conform to what the API expects to receive (as shown in the documentation provided above). Let's see what this looks like.

Start by creating an object called sortByOptions.
29.
The object should have three keys (in this order):

Best Match
Highest Rated
Most Reviewed
Make sure the keys are strings.
30.
Next, set the values. Use the documentation to help you set the values of those keys. The sort_by entry in the table of the "Parameters" section will be helpful. The values should be strings. See if you can find the keys before looking at the hint.
Stuck? Get a hint
Create the <SearchBar /> Component
31.
Let's start building the search bar component. Use the React library to create a component called SearchBar. Don't add a render() method just yet.
Create renderSortByOptions()
32.
Create a method called renderSortByOptions() in the body of the component declaration.
33.
The purpose of renderSortByOptions() is to dynamically create the list items needed to display the sort options (Best Match, Highest Rated, Most Reviewed). This is to help future proof against potential changes to the Yelp API.

The method should iterate through the keys and values of the sortByOptions object and return a list item. The list item elements should use the keys as an attribute, and the values as content. Let's start building it out.

Start adding a return statement (no parentheses).
Stuck? Get a hint
34.
To iterate through the object, you'll need to start by accessing the keys of the sortByOptionsobject. Call the keys() method on the JavaScript Object library. Pass in sortByOptions as the argument.
Stuck? Get a hint
35.
Now that you have access to the keys, you'll iterate through them using the map() method. Call the map() method by chaining it to the end of the line you just wrote.
Stuck? Get a hint
36.
Pass a callback function to the map() method as an argument. The callback function should have one parameter called sortByOption. The callback function should also use arrow syntax.
37.
renderSortByOptions() {
  return Object.keys(sortByOptions).map(sortByOption => {

  });
}
38.
Now let's store the object values in a variable. Inside of the callback function, access the sortByOptions values using the sortByOption parameter of the callback function. Store values in variable called sortByOptionValue.
Stuck? Get a hint
39.
On the next line, return a <li> element. The list item should have an attribute called key set to sortByOptionValue (don't forget to use curly braces to inject JavaScript). The content of the list item should be sortByOption. Again, use curly braces to achieve the JavaScript injection.
Stuck? Get a hint
40.
Great, you're done with renderSortByOptions()! You'll use this method when building the structure of the search bar component.
Render the <SearchBar /> Component
41.
Let's build the structure of the <SearchBar /> component. Start by adding a render() method.
42.
Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.

Follow the guidelines below when you write the HTML (linked above) as JSX:

Change all class attributes to className.
Do not change the class values, as we will use them in the next step to add style to the search bar component.
Replace the comment with a call to .renderSortByOptions().
Export the <SearchBar /> Component
43.
That's it for the SearchBar component! This list component will need to be rendered again by another component, so you'll need to export it. At the bottom of the file, export SearchBar.
Import React and App.css
44.
It's time to put all of the components together!

Open the App.js file in the default App/ directory.

At the top of App.js, import the the following (in this order):

The React library
App.css
Make sure that App.css has this CSS.
Import <BusinessList /> and <SearchBar />
45.
You'll need to import the <BusinessList /> and <SearchBar/ > components too. Next, import BusinessList and SearchBar. You'll have to use the correct path to import them.
Stuck? Get a hint
Modify the Default <App /> Component
46.
The create-react-app command creates a default App component for you. It includes a render() method along with a return statement. We won't need the default App component, so let's make some modifications. Delete everything inside of the return statement.
Render Ravenous
47.
Inside of the App.js .render() method, return JSX that renders this HTML.

Follow the guidelines below when you write the HTML (linked above) as JSX:

Change the class attribute to className.
Do not change the class values, as we will use them to add style to the website.
Replace the comments with their corresponding components.
Export <App />
48.
By default, the create-react-app command adds a default export in the class declaration of the App component, making it look like the following:

export default class App extends Component {
  // Code
}
To be consistent across with how components are exported in the Ravenous project, remove the export default from the beginning of the class declaration. Instead, export App at the bottom of the file (you've done this for all components so far).
Completion and Reflection
49.
Congratulations! You completed the first part of the Ravenous project. Let's briefly review what you built:

A Business component that simulates a single business
A BusinessList component that simulates a list of single businesses
A SearchBar component that will be used in the future to search for business
The App component renders a SearchBar component and a BusinessList component. The final product is a simulation of how the Ravenous project will look and work. Some functionality (like querying the Yelp API) is currently missing, but you'll build it in the upcoming projects.

Reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, consider the following question:

At the moment, some information (like business information) is hard coded into specific components. How might you pass this information dynamically between components?
We'll expand each component through the coming weeks to address the question above (and more).

**************************************************************************************

Part 2:

RAVENOUS PROJECT
Passing Information
Welcome to the second part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the first part of this project. You:

Used create-react-app to start your project
Built all of the components you'll need for the remainder of the project
Simulated what Ravenous should look like after returning search results
In this project, you'll complete the second part of Ravenous: Passing Information to Components.

So far, you've hard coded business information and rendered it manually. Now we'll focus on how information (like business information) can pass from component to component with less hard coding. This is crucial as we build towards the goal of constructing a Yelp-like clone.

A few notes before getting started:

You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It's OK if it is not all finished in one day.
If you don't understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we'll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.
Let's get started!
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Get Started
1.
Future parts of this project will implement the Yelp API. That specific functionality will require that you pass information from the Yelp API to multiple components. In this project, you'll build the initial portions that will set your project up for this functionality in the future.
2.
In another terminal window, cd into the Ravenous directory and type the following command:

npm start
This command will start a development server and open up a preview of your app in a browser tab. As you build, the preview will automatically update when you save your work. This is a great way of seeing your progress in real-time.
Create businesses Array
3.
When the Yelp API is implemented, a list of businesses will be returned to App.js. Therefore, we should create a hard-coded list of businesses there and then pass them to the appropriate components.

Open Business.js. Cut the entire business object and paste it into App.js.

Make sure to paste it right after the imports and above the App class declaration.
4.
Take a look at BusinessList.js. What do you notice about the contents of the BusinessList div?

There's a lot of repetition here. Specifically, the <Business /> component is repeated six times. Recall that we manually did this in the BusinessList component so that we can simulate a list of returned business. We'll refactor this to remove some of the component repetition.

Go back to App.js. Under the business object, create a businesses array. The array should hold six instances of the business object.
Stuck? Get a hint
Setting a BusinessList Prop
5.
Remember, our goal is to remove the repetition of components inside of the <BusinessList /> component. Let's add some more functionality to aid this goal.

In app.js, add a businesses property to the <BusinessList /> component inside of the render() method. Set the property equal to the businesses array. (Don't forget your curly braces!)
Stuck? Get a hint

Add Functionality to the BusinessList Prop
6.
When the businesses prop is set in the BusinessList component, there should be some functionality behind it. Specifically, it should iterate through the businesses array. Recall that you created an array of businesses in App.js.

Open BusinessList.js. Remove everything inside of the BusinessList div (the repeated components).

Inside of the BusinessList div, access the businesses prop and call the .map() method on it.
Stuck? Get a hint
7.
Inside of the map() method, pass a callback function with one parameter called business.
8.
The callback function should return a <Business /> component. The returned <Business /> should have a property called business. Set the property equal to the parameter of the callback function. (Don't forget your curly braces and semicolon!)
Modifying Business.js using Props
9.
Let's review what you've done so far:

Moved business information to App.js
Created a list of businesses using an array, rather than repeating components in BusinessList.js
Built functionality for the BusinessList component to iterate through the array and return Business components
You're just about done! With the changes you've made, however, the Business component will have to access business information differently. This is what you'll build next.

Open Business.js. What do you notice about how information is accessed inside of the return statement?

Because the business object was removed, statements like the following no longer have any meaning:

{business.imageSrc}
Business information now has to be accessed via the business prop you set in BusinessList.js. Modify all statements (like the one in the example above) by prepending them with this.props.
Completion and Reflection
10.
Congratulations! You completed the second part of the Ravenous project. Let's briefly review what you did:

Moved business information to the container component (App)
Passed information from parent components (App) to child components (BusinessList, Business)
This is typical of the flow of information in React apps. You'll continue to build on this structure as you move on to future parts of this project.

Finally, reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, consider the following questions:

The "Let's Go" button doesn't do anything at the moment. How might you simulate a query to the Yelp API?
A user may decide to search with a different sorting option (for example, "Highest Rated", or "Most Reviewed"). How can you handle this change in state using React?
We'll expand the search bar in the coming weeks to address the questions above (and more).

***********************************************************************

Part 3:

Ravenous Project
Setting the Search Bar's State

Welcome to the third part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the second part of this project. You:

    Moved business information to the container component (App)
    Passed information from parent components (App) to child components (BusinessList, Business)

In this project, you'll complete the third part of Ravenous: Setting the State of Ravenous Components.

Certain components will need to handle changes in their state. For example, the sorting options in the search bar will change (and we'll need to know their state when communicating with the Yelp API). The same goes for the two input elements. These are the kinds of changes you'll handle in this project.

A few notes before getting started:

    You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It's OK if it is not all finished in one day.
    If you don't understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we'll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.

Let's get started!
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Add a SearchBar Constructor
1.

Throughout this project, you'll work mainly on setting state and handling state changes in SearchBar.js.

By the end of this project, the search bar options will reflect changes in their state when they are clicked, and the "Let's Go" button will respond to click events. Let's get started.

Open SearchBar.js. Add a constructor in the SearchBar component.

Make sure to pass the constructor props and call super(props) on the first line.
2.

Inside of the constructor, set the initial state of the search bar.

Use this.state and set it equal to an empty object.
3.

Add three keys to the state object you just created. The keys should be term, location, and sortBy.

term will refer to the search term located in the search input, location will refer to the location to search near from the location input, and sortBy will represent the selected sorting option to use.

The first two keys should be set to empty strings (''). The last key should be set to 'best_match'. This completes the constructor.
Get a Sort Option's Class
4.

Click on the sort options above the two input elements on the Ravenous page. You'll notice that nothing happens. They remain the same color and there is no way to determine which option has been selected. This a problem for two reasons:

    A user doesn't receive feedback after clicking on a sort option
    The Yelp API won't know which results to return if it isn't clear which sort option has been selected

We'll fix this by creating a method that returns the current CSS class of the sort options, returning whether or not each one should be styled as if it has been selected.

Under the sortByOptions object, add a new method called getSortByClass that accepts one parameter called sortByOption.
5.

Inside, use an if statement to check if the state value of sortBy is equal to the provided sortByOption. If it is, return 'active', otherwise, return an empty string ('').

sortBy is in the this.state object.
Handle a Change in Sort Option
6.

getSortByClass() returns the current CSS class for a sorting option. This method will prove useful in providing visual feedback to users of Ravenous.

We'll need another method, however, that sets the state of a sorting option. This method will be useful when communicating with the Yelp API in the future.

Add a new method called handleSortByChange. It should accept a parameter called sortByOption.
7.

Inside of .handleSortByChange(), update the state by calling .setState(). Pass in an object to setState(). The object should set sortBy to the value of the method's argument.

Familiarize yourself with this pattern. You'll make use of it in upcoming steps.
Set the Class Name of a Sort Option
8.

Let's put these two new methods to work.

Take a look at the .renderSortByOptions() method. You'll modify the return statement that returns an <li> element with these two new methods.

Add a className attribute to the <li> element. Set it equal to the return value of the getSortByClass() method. Pass in sortByOptionValue as the argument.

This will conditionally style each sort by option, displaying to the user which sorting option is currently selected.
Handle a Sorting Option Change (On Click)
9.

Next, we'll update the state of a sorting option when it is clicked.

Add an onClick attribute to the <li> element. Set it equal to handleSortByChange.bind(). Pass in two arguments to .bind(): this and sortByOptionValue.

This will allow us to both bind to the current value of this (as we usually do in the constructor()) but also bind the current sortByOptionValue as the first argument to the method call, ensuring the method is called with the appropriate value when clicked.
Handle a Term or Location Change
10.

Ravenous will also need to handle changes in the two input elements. Specifically, it will need to handle changes in "Terms" (businesses) and "Location" (location to search in).

Under the handleSortByChange() method, add two new methods:

    handleTermChange()
    handleLocationChange()

Since both will be related to events being triggered, both should accept event as an argument.
11.

Inside of each method, update the state using setState(). Pass in an empty object into each call of setState().

Use step 8 to help you (you've done this before).
12.

Inside of both methods, the state of each input element should be updated to reflect the text typed into the respective input element.

In .handleTermChange(), the object passed to .setState() should have a key called term. Set the key to a value of event.target.value.

{term: event.target.value}

13.

Do the same thing in .handleLocationChange(), but name the key location instead.
Bind Methods in the Constructor
14.

Since both of these methods use this), you'll need to bind them. Above the sortByOptions object in the constructor(), bind both methods (handleTermChange() and handleLocationChange()) to the current value of this.
Handle a Term or Location Change (onChange)
15.

Let's use the methods!

Inside of the return statement of the component's render() method, add onChange attributes to each <input> element:

    Set the first attribute to handle term changes.
    Set the second attribute to handle location changes.

Use step 10 to help you (you've done this kind of thing before).
searchYelp() in the App Component
16.

The functionality you just built will provide feedback to the user when they select a different sorting option.

The "Let's Go" button also needs to provide some sort of feedback to the user. Currently, clicking on it doesn't do anything. Let's build functionality that simulates what a search might look like.

In App.js, add a method called searchYelp() in the class declaration of the App component. (Place it above the render() method.)
17.

searchYelp() should accept three parameters: term, location, and sortBy. These parameters represent the three pieces of information we'll send to the Yelp API in the next project.
18.

Remember, we're building partial functionality to simulate a search. You'll complete this functionality in the next project.

Inside of searchYelp(), log a message to the console that uses the three parameters.

Here's an example message:

Searching Yelp with Pizza, Brooklyn, best_match

Use interpolation to help you write the message.
Set the searchYelp Prop in SearchBar
19.

Let's use this method. Add a searchYelp property to the SearchBar component in the return statement of .render().

Set it equal to this.searchYelp.

Use step 10 to help you (you've done this kind of thing before).
Handle a Search
20.

searchYelp() will print a message to the console, simulating a search. This will only happen when the "Let's Go" button is clicked, which is the missing functionality you'll build now.

In SearchBar.js, add a method called handleSearch(). Place it under the handleLocationChange() method.
21.

.handleSearch() should accept an event parameter.

Inside of .handleSearch(), call the passed down .searchYelp() method (located on props). Pass in the current state values of term, location, and sortBy as arguments.
22.

On the next line, call event.preventDefault() to prevent the default action of clicking a link from triggering at the end of the method.
Bind handleSearch()
23.

Next, bind the handleSearch() method. Place it under three methods you previously bound.
Handle a Search (onClick)
24.

The last step is to put handleSearch() to work.

Add an onClick attribute to the "Let's Go" button. Set it equal to this.handleSearch.
Completion and Reflection
25.

Take a look at Ravenous in your browser. Click through the sort options at the top of the search bar. What do you notice? What kind of visual feedback do you receive upon clicking a sort option?

Next, open the developer tools in your browser (i.e. the console in Google Chrome). Enter a business name (or food type, like "pizza") and a city into the search bar. Then click on the "Let's Go" button. What does the console output?
26.

Congratulations! You've completed the third part of the Ravenous project. Let's review what you built:

    Added visual feedback for the sorting options at the top of the search bar
    Set the state of sorting options and input elements
    Simulated a search query with the "Let's Go" button

Reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, consider the following question:

    How can we interact with the Yelp API using the "Let's Go" button?

We'll expand the functionality of the "Let's Go" button in the next project to address the question above.
